# open-ephys

Windows compiled binaries for Open Ephys GUI (https://github.com/open-ephys/plugin-GUI)

Tested on Windows 7.

To launch the application, double-click on “open-ephys.exe”

If you receive an error message saying that “msvcr120.dll” is missing, you will need to install the Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013 (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784).

Before using the software with the Open Ephys acquisition board, run "FrontPanelUSB-DriverOnly-4.4.0.exe” to install the Opal Kelly drivers.

To show the debug console, run “open-ephys.exe --console” from the cmd prompt.
